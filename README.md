## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: **Which versions of Angular and Spring Boot should I use?**
**A1**: You should use the **latest stable versions** of Angular and Spring Boot at the time of your development. Ensure that your setup uses up-to-date libraries and frameworks to reflect modern development practices. Include the specific versions used in your documentation (`README.md`).

---

### Q2: **Can I use a different front-end framework instead of Angular?**
**A2**: **No**, the task is designed to evaluate your Angular skills, so please use Angular as specified. Feel free to use Angular Material or Bootstrap for styling.

---

### Q3: **What database should I use?**
**A3**: You can use any database of your choice, such as:
- **Relational databases**: H2 (in-memory), MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
- **NoSQL databases**: MongoDB or any other NoSQL database you prefer.

Make sure to use the latest stable version of the database library. Include configuration instructions in your `README.md` on how to set up the chosen database. If you use a NoSQL database, ensure that the data model fits the requirements of the task.

---

### Q4: **Do I need to write tests for this project?**
**A4**: Tests are not mandatory, but they are highly recommended. Adding unit tests (e.g., using JUnit/Mockito for backend and Jasmine/Karma for frontend) will give you bonus points during evaluation.

---

### Q5: **Should I implement pagination and sorting?**
**A5**: Pagination and sorting are optional but encouraged. If you decide to implement them, please add a brief description in your README on how they work.

---

### Q6: **How should I structure my Angular components and services?**
**A6**: Follow standard Angular practices by using separate components for each view (e.g., `EmployeeListComponent`, `EmployeeFormComponent`) and services for API calls (e.g., `EmployeeService`). Ensure that your code is modular and organized.

---

### Q7: **Can I use libraries like Lombok in the backend or NgRx in the frontend?**
**A7**: Yes, feel free to use any library that makes development easier as long as it aligns with best practices and improves readability. Just make sure to document it in your `README.md`. Use the latest version of any external library to avoid compatibility issues.

---

### Q8: **What should I do if I find unclear requirements or have questions?**
**A8**: If you encounter unclear requirements, make reasonable assumptions and document them in your `README.md`. This shows your ability to handle ambiguity and think through problems independently. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn message.

---

### Q9: **What should the final submission include?**
**A9**: The final submission should include:
1. **Source code** for both the front end and back end.
2. A **README.md** file with setup instructions and an overview of your solution.
3. Optional: **Unit tests** if implemented.
4. Any additional documentation you think is relevant (e.g., Postman collection, Swagger).

---

### Q10: **Can I use Docker to containerize the application?**
**A10**: Yes, if you are comfortable with Docker, feel free to add Docker support. While not required, itâ€™s a nice addition and will be considered a bonus.
